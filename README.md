This project is now "abandoned".  I will eventually write new code that will use a Raspberry Pi and OpenCV to do the image recognition.  This one used a pixy (CMUcam 5) to detect a coloured blob and actuate servos in a specific patter.  (for a custom designed drop bay)  

It has a nice LCD output that lets you monitor the drops/status.  It even has a PWM input to arm/disarm the system. The aim was to drop a package from a remote control plane as it flew over a target.  It worked quite well so I thought I would put it up in case it's useful to someone.


detect-and-drop
===============
Software that recognises "Outback Joe" (it only recognised coloured blobs but worked well) and drops packages to him.  Used by BrisbaneUAV in the 2014 high school outback challenge.
